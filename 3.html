	<h2>JavaScript</h2>

	<p>
	JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language 
	that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
	As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior 
	often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers 
	have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
